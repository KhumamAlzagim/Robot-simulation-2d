# Robot Simulation System

## Overview
This project is designed to simulate the motion of mobile robots within a virtual environment, with the potential for future extension to other mobile cyber-physical systems.

## Simulation Environment
The environment is a grid partitioned into squares where the size, the number of robots, and their initial positions, as well as exit points, can be specified before running the simulation.

## Simulation Dynamics
Robots move towards their nearest exit, and the simulation operates on a continuous-time tick, with each cycle allowing the robots to move up to two squares.

## Visualization
A 2D visualization module displays the current simulation cycle and the number of robots remaining.

## Project Goals
- Develop the simulation engine to model robot movement accurately.
- Create a decoupled 2D visualization module to represent the simulation state.

## Further Development
Future updates may include UAVs and autonomous vehicles within the simulation scope.
